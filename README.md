MOBITANGGA â€“ Final Project (ALSTUKDAT)
IF2111 â€“ Group 19 (Academic Year 2021/2022)

MOBITANGGA is a Command-Line Interface (CLI) based game developed as an implementation of Abstract Data Types (ADT) taught in the IF2111 course.
This game is a creative adaptation of the classic Snakes and Ladders game, redesigned with inspiration from the legendary Doraemon universe and built entirely in the C programming language.

The game supports 2 to 4 players and is played on a board of length N. At the start of the game, all players begin at tile 1 and race to reach tile N. The first player to arrive at tile N wins the game.

The game map and configurations are defined through an external configuration file (.txt), which includes:

Total number of tiles

Board layout (as a string)

maxRoll â€“ maximum dice outcome

Number and positions of teleporters (entry and exit tiles)

How to Run the Program

Before running MOBITANGGA, the program must be compiled, as it is written entirely in the C language.
To do this, a C compiler is required. One option is to install Code::Blocks, available at:
ðŸ”— http://www.codeblocks.org/downloads

Once your C compiler is installed, you may proceed with one of the following options:

Clone this repository, or

Download the .zip file and extract it to your desired folder

Configuration Files

We provide two configuration files categorized by game difficulty:

Level 1: test1.txt

Level 2: test2.txt

Each file contains map structure, teleporters, and game rules specific to its level.

If you'd like, I can add:
âœ… Gameplay Instructions
âœ… Example Commands
âœ… Screenshots or ASCII Board Preview
